# Boop
***Become a friend of the sneks***

**NOW WITH SWITCH SUPPORT!**

Current release: **2.0.0**

Boop is a C# implementation of the [servefiles.py from FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/tree/2.4.5/servefiles) and [remote_install_pc.py from Tinfoil](https://github.com/Adubbz/Tinfoil/blob/master/tools/remote_install_pc.py)

Boop is completely rewritten in C# and thus is snek friendly (No python needed).
